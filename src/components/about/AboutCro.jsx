            <p>
              In 2010 Late Mr. D.P.Sharma and four activists started CRO they
              felt that something needed to be done to improve the situation of
              the common consumer. In this age the moral ethics in trade or
              business has fallen on ground for maximum profits. Even eatables
              are being adulterated in search of money making. This is an
              important concern for the founders. These all aspects which are
              happening with consumers were the reason behind the formation of
              Upbhokta Adhikar Sangthan (CRO - Consumer Rights Organization).

            presence in 24 states and union territories of India.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are working for Consumer Awareness, Consumer Education and
            Consumer Protection. We work on specially designed activities to
            aware consumers regarding Consumer Rights, Responsibilities, Food

            consumers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of the several laws that have been enacted to protect the rights of
            consumers in India, the most significant is the Consumer Protection
            Act, 2019. Under this law, everyone, including individuals, a Hindu
            undivided family, a firm, and a company, can exercise their consumer
            rights for the goods and services purchased by them. It is important
            that, as consumers, we know at least our basic rights and about the
            courts and procedures that deal with the infringement of our rights.
